        "description": "The first thing you will need in order to do a skate 2 speedrun is a console on which you can run the game, and if you want to submit the run a means of recording your game.\n In terms of consoles, there are several key differences. Modern playstations do not support skate 2, so the only playstation console which will support the game is the PS3. Alternatively, RPCS3 can be used, although will be hidden by default on the leaderboards, since it is not an official release of the game.\n All Xbox consoles since Xbox 360 support the game, however the game is no longer digitally for sale. This means that if your console does not support physical disks you will need to already have the digital game owned on your account in order to use it.\n Timing your run is not required, although may be useful as a tool. The time of the run can be calculated from the complete recording of the game. The recording must include the game audio and complete, unbroken footage of the game. You can achieve this either by using a capture card, or by directly recording the screen on which you're playing the game."

        "description": "When setting up your character in the game, you can configure the character however you like. The time to set up the character does not count towards the run.\n It's recommended to turn off the music from within the audio settings, since the music within the game is copyrighted and some platforms for uploading the video will mute the audio. This isn't a requirement however as long as a full audio version of the run is available in some way to the moderators when verifying the run.\nYou can also update the camera angle, if you prefer high camera, before beginning the run."

        "description": "There is one key speed glitch used within the skate 2 run, in order to achieve it you need to first pop a trick into the air (ideally an ollie). Once in the air, grab the board backside, this will be left trigger if in regular stance or right trigger if in goofy stance. Then press the %y% button to begin getting off the board (while still holding the trigger). As you begin to get off the board, you press %y% again to get back on the board in such a way that the board is angled as you contact the floor.",

        "description": "Everyone knows that it takes three pushes to get to max speed, but did you know you can push quicker than just holding the %a% or %x% button? When we move the right analog stick with all other buttons neutral, our skater quickly gets into position ready to perform a trick. We can use this faster return to the neutral stance in between pushes to push at almost double the speed. As soon as you have gained the full benefit of a push, flick the analog stick to return to the neutral position and push again",

        "title": "Fast Pause",
        "description": "During the game, your game will save at multiple points. You can see that the game has saved because we get an orange spinner and a message saying 'saving content'. One of the most egregious cases of this from a speedrun perspective is after challenge completion. We will complete many challenges during the course of the speedrun, and while the spinner is saving we are not allowed to perform some actions; such as pausing the game.\nA way to circumvent this is to perform a fast pause. This trick is not yet particularly consistent, but the goal is to pause between a challenge ending and the pause spinner appearing. The window for this is extremely small, so requires very fast input between the %a% press to remove the challenge completion screen and the pause press. When it works, you will be in the menu while the save spinner saves the game.",

It's also possible (very rarely) to skip one of the cutscenes at the top of the stairs, a consistent method of achieving this is yet to be found.\n When grabbing the dumpster, make sure you turn both sticks to the right to spin the dumpster around yourself and move your foot into the cutscene zone at the top of slappy's park.\nOn the tricks, you can start the ollie a little bit quicker if you hold a manual as you begin the challenge then pop out of it.",

        "description": "In this challenge the game expects us to skate down, move the ramp, then skate again over to jump up onto the top of the box. We can instead take a tight angle as we hit the kicker and pop up onto the top of the box. If you hit a grind, you may still survive even hitting the barrel on the top. Try to skate off the other end towards the exit of the park for the next challenge.",

Sometimes slappy can bail at the bottom of the tunnel, so be careful as it's easy to fail. Slappy has two routes after the tunnel he may choose, keep an eye on whether he goes left or right and try to stay closer to that side into the end."

It is just barely possible to clear the dumpsters without footplanting, although you also aren't allowed to grind them, so to achieve this you have to double grab and rotate to an angle which stops your skater from locking in a grind on the dumpster.",

The trick to doing this challenge quickly is to try to keep as high speed as possible and avoid going up/down the ramps (since that loses speed). If you pick a very straight line through  you can hit 4 very quickly, while also managing to end with a faster load to the next challenge.",

        "description": "This challenge is probably the first more difficult one within the run, and is an easy way to lose a lot of time. The only requirement is that for each flat part of the ledge you are touch it in a manual. You are not allowed to grind, nor drop the manual, nor skip a ledge. With two regular pushes, it's possble to manual and pop the downward sections, be careful you don't line up for a grind.\nAn alternative easier strategy is to go down in a switch manual, as this is less likely to bottom out and end the manual when going down the downward sloped sections",

Then go to Challenge Map > Locations > Landmarks > Top of urban rez. This will put you in a prime place to pick up two of the pools. Skate down the hill (you can tri-push/speed glitch to speed this up), at the bottom set a session marker then turn right. Sneak between the fence and the building, being very careful not to bail here and pick up the community pool.\nReturn to your session marker and skate down to the Do-Drop Inn pool, be careful when you drop down that you are not going to fast to get over the curb, ideally you take the small gap between the ledge and the dumpster to get there as fast as possible.\nLastly we open the challenge map and then *x* to show completed challenges, warp to Film > School's out, quit the challenge and go right to get to the GED pool.",

We don't need to worry too much about score, although it is possible to lose to Danny, especially if we are going slow. We need to make sure we win at least 2 of the runs, so if you notice Danny has won one, you need to pay more attention to your score and ensure you beat him.\nThere are many routes through the megapark, but the sweet spot between fast and consistent is to lose a little speed on the first ramp downwards and come off to the right, then skate round two corners and direct to the finish. If you land in the final bowl area in fakie with a grab, you can turn much tighter into the end area. Try to avoid bailing in to the end on the last run as this will lose a lot of time.",
